## Procedure

Please follow these steps to do the real experiment.

#### Equipment and Materials:

- Membrane module (e.g., hollow fiber, flat sheet, spiral wound)

- Feed solution (the solution to be separated)

- Permeate collection container

- Pump or pressure source

- Pressure gauges

- Flow meters

- Temperature measuring device (e.g., thermometer)

- Stopwatch or timer

- pH meter (if applicable)



#### Setup:

-Set up the membrane module according to the manufacturer's instructions. <br>
-Connect the feed solution container to the inlet of the membrane module.<br>
-Connect the permeate collection container to the outlet of the membrane module.<br>
-Ensure all connections are secure and leak-free.<br>
-Make sure the pump or pressure source is properly connected and ready for operation.<br>
### Preparing the Membrane:
-If the membrane is new, it may require pre-treatment or conditioning. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for membrane preparation, if applicable.<br>
-Flush the membrane module with clean water or an appropriate cleaning solution to remove any contaminants or air bubbles.<br>

### Membrane Separation Experiment:
-Start the pump or apply pressure to the system to initiate the flow of feed solution through the membrane module.<br>
-Measure and record the initial operating conditions, such as pressure, flow rate, and temperature.<br>
-Allow the system to stabilize for a predetermined time to achieve a steady-state condition.<br>
-Collect permeate samples at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) or as per the experimental design.<br>
-Measure and record the permeate properties of interest, such as concentration, purity, or volume.<br>
-Monitor and record the operating conditions throughout the experiment.<br>
### Experimental Variables:
-If you are investigating the effect of different variables, such as pressure, temperature, or feed concentration, make appropriate adjustments to these variables in a systematic manner.<br>
-Maintain other operating parameters constant to isolate the effects of the variable under study.<br>
### Post-Experiment:
-Analyze the collected data, including the permeate samples and operating conditions.<br>
-Calculate separation performance parameters, such as flux, selectivity, or rejection rate, depending on your specific experiment.<br>
-Draw conclusions based on the results and compare them with your expectations or previous research..<br>
### Clean-up:
-Turn off the pump or pressure source and disconnect the equipment.<br>
-Clean the membrane module and other equipment thoroughly according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
-Dispose of any waste materials, such as contaminated feed solutions, properly and in accordance with your institution's guidelines.<br>
