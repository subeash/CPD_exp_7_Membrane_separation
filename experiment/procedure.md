## Procedure

Please follow these steps to do the real experiment.

#### Equipment and Materials:

-Membrane module (e.g., hollow fiber, flat sheet, spiral wound)
-Feed solution (the solution to be separated)
-Permeate collection container
-Pump or pressure source
-Pressure gauges
-Flow meters
-Temperature measuring device (e.g., thermometer)
-Stopwatch or timer
-pH meter (if applicable)
-Safety goggles and gloves

#### Setup:

-Set up the membrane module according to the manufacturer's instructions.
-Connect the feed solution container to the inlet of the membrane module.
-Connect the permeate collection container to the outlet of the membrane module.
-Ensure all connections are secure and leak-free.
-Make sure the pump or pressure source is properly connected and ready for operation.
### Preparing the Membrane:
-If the membrane is new, it may require pre-treatment or conditioning. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for membrane preparation, if applicable.
-Flush the membrane module with clean water or an appropriate cleaning solution to remove any contaminants or air bubbles.

### Membrane Separation Experiment:
-Start the pump or apply pressure to the system to initiate the flow of feed solution through the membrane module.
-Measure and record the initial operating conditions, such as pressure, flow rate, and temperature.
-Allow the system to stabilize for a predetermined time to achieve a steady-state condition.
-Collect permeate samples at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) or as per the experimental design.
-Measure and record the permeate properties of interest, such as concentration, purity, or volume.
-Monitor and record the operating conditions throughout the experiment.
### Experimental Variables:
-If you are investigating the effect of different variables, such as pressure, temperature, or feed concentration, make appropriate adjustments to these variables in a systematic manner.
-Maintain other operating parameters constant to isolate the effects of the variable under study.
### Post-Experiment:
-Analyze the collected data, including the permeate samples and operating conditions.
-Calculate separation performance parameters, such as flux, selectivity, or rejection rate, depending on your specific experiment.
-Draw conclusions based on the results and compare them with your expectations or previous research..
### Clean-up:
-Turn off the pump or pressure source and disconnect the equipment.
-Clean the membrane module and other equipment thoroughly according to the manufacturer's instructions.
-Dispose of any waste materials, such as contaminated feed solutions, properly and in accordance with your institution's guidelines.
